The files for your difficulties can be pasted and edited in the text box. After clicking Save , the file will be saved based on the name in the Name top level field; if the file already existed, it will be overwritten. Difficulties get saved inside your mod config. You can check all your difficulties by clicking on the drop-down menu. The Reset button sets a difficulty as a default upon starting the game. The CD2 files CD2 files are in the JSON format. CD1 files are not compatible with CD2. The top level fields of the file are modules with different functionalities. If a module or a field is missing from a CD2 file, the value from the BaseHazard for the file is taken. The BaseHazard can be specified inside the DifficultySetting module. If none is specified, the base hazard is Hazard 5. A file that is just {} represents vanilla Hazard 5. Most fields that admit floats or ints accept also an array of the same type: { \"Caps\": { \"MaxActiveEnemies\": [90, 120, 180, 180] } } which means that MaxActiveEnemies scales with the number of players, 1 to 4, with the values specified inside.

The difficulty can only contain either the Enemies module or EnemiesNoSync : Enemies can replicate some enemy characteristics to players, such as materials and scale, but in exchange it forces the clients to use CD2 or they will suffer a disconnect upon mission start. EnemiesNoSync doesn't do replication to clients. A difficulty with EnemiesNoSync is compatible with all clients, regardless of whether they use CD1, CD2 or nothing at all.

VeteranClasses See Veteran control below. Enemy controls Fields inside [[]] are special submodules that can be found in the sections that follow. Name Type Comments Alert Boolean If True, the enemy will spawn aggroed to the player. It is True by default in enemies spawned by a wave spawner . AttackDamageMultiplier Float Multiplies an enemy's melee and projectile damage. Can be used with EnemiesNoSync. Base ED The enemy will have the specified ED as base. Check the table in Resources for the vanilla descriptors. CanPlayerStandOn Boolean CaveLeech [[CaveLeech]] See the CaveLeech module below for special Cave Leech controls. Courage Float Direct [Int, Float, Bool, Pcol] Special control that can expose enemy properties (see example below). DisplayName String Elite Float | Bool This field accepts a float number indicating the percentage of Elite enemies that will spawn for that descriptor. EnemyHealthScaling String ForceEliteBase ED See Elite variants for all enemies below. Grabber [[Grabber]] See the Grabber module below for special Grabber controls. IsBossFight Boolean If True, the enemy will have a boss bar in the player UI similar to the vanilla dreadnoughts. The name in the bar will be the descriptor's DisplayName . JellyBreeder [[JellyBreeder]] See the JellyBreeder module below for special breeder controls. Heal Float A positive number N will heal the enemy N hps. A negative number will do N dps to the enemy. HealthMultiplier Float HealthRaw Float Materials [[Materials]] A list of UE4 materials that will be applied to different parts of the enemy. Each enemy is different with regard to how many materials will it accept and how will they be applied, so trial and error is usually needed to get the expected results. MEV Special Movement [[Movement]] See the Movement submodule below. NoSpawnWithin Float Removes enemies that spawn within the specified distance of the player, in cm. Projectile [[Projectile]] See Projectiles . PST_CritBonusDamage Int Multiplies the normal damage in case of a Critical Hit (see PST_CritBonusDamage below). Default of 1.2 (20 % bonus). PST_CritChance Int Chance of both bugs dealing Critical Damage to players or the other way around (no way to have only one direction). Defaults to 0 (0 % chance). PST_DamageFromPlayers Int Multiplies all damage sources considered to be from players (including things like temperature shock damage). Defaults to 1. PST_ExplodeOnDeath Int When the enemy dies it explodes as if it was a Volatile Bugs mission. PST_MovementSpeed Int Modifies enemy speed. This is a legacy pawn stat. See the Movement module below for a more customizable module new in CD2. Resistances [[Resistances]] See the Resistances submodule below. Scale Float Spawner [[Spawner]] See Spawners below. ShowHealthBar Boolean StaggerImmunityWindow Float StaggerDurationMultiplier Float Temperature [[Temperature]] See the Temperature submodule below. TimeDilation Float Speeds up the enemy's attack and movement. Please note that time-dilating enemies can be a source of desync. UsesBiomeVariants Boolean Enables/disables the biome variants of enemies (eg. Frost Praetorian in Glacial Strata). WeakpointHP Float Direct special control Direct allows to directly change enemy properties as defined in UE4. Many properties that are not directly exposed by CD2 can be changed with Direct . For example: \"ED_Spider_ExploderTank\": { \"Direct\": { \"Int:NumClusterBombs\": 200 } } \"ED_Spider_Exploder\": { \"Movement\": { \"MaxPawnSpeed\": 5, \"MaxAcceleration\": 5, \"MaxBrakingDeceleration\": 10, \"AlignDirectionSpeed\": 10, \"AlignToTargetMinRequiredAngle\": 1, \"StrafeSpeed\": 5 }, \"Direct\": { \"PCol:Mesh\": true }, \"CanPlayerStandOn\": true, \"Alert\": true } \"ED_JellyBreeder\": { \"Direct\": { \"Bool:Capsule.bHiddenInGame\": false, \"PCol:Capsule\": true }, \"CanPlayerStandOn\": true } Elite variants for all enemies Setting Elite to true or to some float number will only work directly for those enemies that have a vanilla elite variant: guards, grabbers, praetorians, bulks, menaces and trijaws. For the rest of the enemies, an elite base must be specified by setting ForceEliteBase to some existing ED that has an elite variant. As an example, the following snippet creates an elite septic spreader, which won't work without the ForceEliteBase : \"ED_Elite_Septic_Spreader\": { \"Base\": \"ED_Spider_Lobber\", \"Elite\": true, \"ForceEliteBase\": \"ED_Grabber\" } The type of elite specified as base can modify the characteristics of your custom elite descriptor, feel free to experiment. Veteran control Veterans allow some enemies to promote to other enemies. In vanilla the veteran classes are hardcoded (for example, oppressors are praetorians that got promoted with a probability given by the VeteranLarge setting in DifficultySetting ). CD2 improves the system by allowing the player to create their own custom veteran classes. There are currently two ways to interact with the veteran system: VeteranClasses accepts a list of descriptors that the base descriptor can promote to. VeteranClasses uses VeteranNormal probablities unless UsesVeteranLarge is set to true. The following snippet shows an example: \"DifficultySetting\": { \"VeteranNormal\": { [ \"Weight\": 1, \"Min\": 0.2, \"Max\": 0.2 ] } }, \"Enemies\": { \"ED_Spider_Grunt\": { \"VeteranClasses\": [ \"ED_Spider_Shooter\", \"ED_Spider_Spitter\" ] } } With these settings, Grunts will promote to acid and web spitters with a 20 % chance each time they spawn. One disadvantage of this approach is that VeternalNormal and VeteranLarge are global. The second way is CustomVeterans , which bypasses the VeternalNormal and VeteranLarge settings and lets the user specify the probability directly. The following snippet whould work exactly as the one before, but now the probabilities are contained to the grunt descriptor instead of being global: \"ED_Spider_Grunt\": { \"CustomVeterans\": { \"ED_Spider_Grunt\": 0.8, \"ED_Spider_Shooter\": 0.1, \"ED_Spider_Spitter\": 0.1 } } CustomVeterans also allows specifying a mutator to decide which enemies to spawn, which can give more control. One useful use case is to limit the amount of veterans of a certain type: \"ED_Spider_Grunt\": { \"CustomVeterans\": { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoice\", \"Choices\": [ \"ED_Spider_Buffer\", \"ED_Spider_Grunt\", \"ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard\", \"ED_Spider_Grunt_Attacker\" ], \"Weights\": [ { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"EnemyCount\", \"ED\": \"ED_Spider_Buffer\" }, \"<\": 5, \"Then\": 30, \"Else\": 0 }, 1, 1, 1 ] } }, This snippet gives a very high chance of wardens to spawn until there are 5 of them in the map, at which point the probability to get more warden promotions will drop to 0. Custom materials CD2 allows specifying a list of Materials in individual enemy descriptors to customize how the enemies look. This feature requires Enemies for clients to be able to see the changes. Example: create an orange septic. { \"Enemies\": { \"ED_Spider_Lobber\": { \"Materials\": [\"M_Halloween_Light_Orange\", \"M_Halloween_Light_Orange\"] } } } Each enemy has a certain number of material slots. There are hundreds of available materials, but not all of them work when used in enemies. The best way to test and find new materials for your enemies is spawning the enemy in Sandbox Utilities and changing them, and you will be able to see the change in real time. This procedure is explained in this document by @TheBrain. If you wish to leave a slot with the default material, both \"\" and Default work. Resistances Fields for the resistances submodule. These controls can be used to define resistances to all types of damage in the game. DamageMultiplier is the catch-all for all damage types.

A: The mod right now is in open beta and the .pak file can be found in the Practical DRG discord server. The mod integration loader is recommended. Q: Can I use this at the same time as CD1? A: No. Only enable one CD version at a time. If you want to join CD1 lobbies while having CD2 enabled yourself and not suffer a desync in the nitra cost of resupplies, there is a cd1-client.pak available in PDRG that allows to do that. Q: How can I use this? A: Drag and drop the zip file into MINT and press install mods. You do not need to extract the pak from the zip to install. Q: Do clients need CD2 to play in my CD2 lobby? A: Clients only need CD2 if you use certain features. For instance, difficulties that use the Enemies module will require that all clients have CD2. If the EnemiesNoSync is used instead, clients will no longer need CD2. On Pubbing With CD2 is a guide by @Spy detailing which CD2 features are incompatible with pubbing and is a recommended read. Q: Why aren't my original CD1 difficulties compatible with CD2? A: Custom Difficulty v2 is a complete redesign and it uses top level names to denote independent modules. If you need to port something from CD1 to CD2, there is a script that automatically does the translation. Alternatively, you can post the file in the PDRG forums asking for help in running the script or making the port yourself. Q: Does CD2 support more than 4 players? A: Yes CD2 has complete support for more than 4 player lobbies. Any player-count depedent field can be extended to any number of players. Additionally, you can specify MaxPlayers: 8 in your difficulty to set the max players count. Q: Will changing the difficulty mid mission break the game like in CD1?

They are used in a few commonly played difficulties and although they are not directly related to CD2, it is handy to have a list of the new enemy descriptors they add. Some of the enemies here can be replicated with CD2 without needing an external mod with the use of custom materials and projectiles ; some enemies in these mods, however, have changes in their behaviour tree which are impossible to replicate with CD2 for now. Neither of the two mods are in mod.io and they can be found as .pak files in the Practical DRG Discord. The mods don't do anything by themselves: in order to spawn the new enemies, their descriptors have to be included in a CD2 file. A more recent mod is EEE, available in mod.io . You can see the list of EEE enemies here . MEV Descriptions provided by mod author @yinny. Updated for MEV 5.4. Grunt variants These grunts are recolors of the normal grunt and its veterans (Guards and Slashers) to be used for special purposes (eg. to give grunts spawning from nexus a different color from normal grunts). ED name Comments ED_Spider_Grunt_cyan Blue grunt. ED_Spider_Grunt_red Red grunt. ED_Spider_Grunt_white White grunt. ED_Spider_Grunt_yellow Yellow grunt. ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard_cyan Blue guard. ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard_red Red guard. ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard_white White guard. ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard_yellow Yellow guard. ED_Spider_Grunt_Attacker_cyan Blue slasher. ED_Spider_Grunt_Attacker_red Red slasher. ED_Spider_Grunt_Attacker_white White slasher. ED_Spider_Grunt_Attacker_yellow Yellow slasher. Breeders These breeders are recolors of the normal breeder. Their main use is to be able to have multiple breeders spawning different enemies in the same mission, which before CD2 was only partially possible by using the rockpox breeder as a second variant. As an alternative way, CD2 now allows to have multiple breeder descriptors with different settings (see the Breeder module in Enemies .) ED name Comments ED_JellyBreeder_green Green breeder, spawns ED_Jelly_Spawn_dummy_green. ED_JellyBreeder_red Red breeder, spawns ED_Jelly_Spawn_dummy_red. ED_JellyBreeder_purple Purple breeder, spawns ED_Jelly_Spawn_dummy_purple. ED_JellyBreeder_yellow Yellow breeder, spawns ED_Jelly_Spawn_dummy_yellow. To use these, override the specified dummy jelly descriptor with the ED you want to spawn: \"ED_Jelly_Spawn_dummy_purple\": { \"Base\": \"ED_Spider_Exploder\" } will make the purple breeder spawn exploders. Bulks ED name Comments ED_Spider_ExploderTank_black A bulk recolor in black. ED_Spider_ExploderTank_white A bulk recolor in white. ED_Spider_ExploderTank_small A small bulk, commonly called mini-bulk, with a smaller radius explosion. ED_Spider_ExploderTank_big A bigger bulk which also has a huge explosion with magma lining. ED_Spider_ExploderTank_frozen An ice bulk, does no damage but freezes everything around it. ED_Spider_Plantonator A special bulk. When exploding, each bomblet will spawn ED_sprout_spawn in turn, which is a korlok sprout by default but can be changed by specifying a different base. Exploders ED name Comments ED_Spider_Exploder_frost An ice exploder, leaves snow when it explodes. ED_Spider_Exploder_fungus A fungus bogs themed exploder, leaves goo behind when it dies. ED_Spider_Exploder_white A recolor in white. Mactera ED name Comments ED_Mactera_Shooter_HeavyVeteran_cyan Elemental electric brundle. ED_Mactera_Shooter_HeavyVeteran_green Elemental poison brundle.

Menaces ED name Comments ED_Spider_RapidShooter_cyan Elemental electric menace. ED_Spider_RapidShooter_green Elemental poison menace. ED_Spider_RapidShooter_red Elemental fire menace. ED_Spider_RapidShooter_white Elemental ice menace. ED_Spider_RapidShooter_Turbo A rapid-fire shooting menace. Nexus These are recolors of the normal nexus, following the same logic for breeders: they allow to have more than one type of nexus in the same mission. CD2 currently doesn't have a Nexus module to specify the EDs of different nexii (although the effect can be simulated by using Spawner , see in enemies ), so this method is still the simplest. ED name Comments ED_SpiderSpawner_green Green nexus spawning ED_Spider_Spawn_dummy_green. ED_SpiderSpawner_red Red nexus spawning ED_Spider_Spawn_dummy_red. ED_SpiderSpawner_yellow Yellow nexus spawning ED_Spider_Spawn_dummy_yellow. ED_SpiderSpawner_white White nexus spawning ED_Spider_Spawn_dummy_white. Nukeballers Spitballers shooting nukes. Since they provide a different number of shot projectiles, they are an interesting match for custom projectiles . ED name Comments ED_ShootingPlant_NukeSingle Shoots a single projectile. ED_ShootingPlant_Nuke Shoots three projectiles in a row. ED_ShootingPlant_NukeEX Shoots five projectiles in a row. ED_ShootingPlant_NukeU Shoots ten projectiles in a row.

Younglings ED name Comments ED_Woodlouse_Youngling_cyan Blue youngling recolor. ED_Woodlouse_Youngling_red Red youngling recolor. Miscellaneous enemies ED name Comments ED_Lootbug_bulk Mimic lootbug. Can't be pet and when killed it explodes like a bulk detonator. ED_CaveLeech_cloak A leech with the stalker material. ED_CaveLeech_silent A silent leech. ED_PatrolBot_missile A special patrol bot with a different attack pattern. ED_PatrolBot_rocketbeam A special patrol bot with a different attack pattern. DEA Descriptions provided by the mod author @donnie_danko. Updated for version 5.5. Grunts and spitter variants ED name Comments ED_Spider_Glasher A hybrid of the Guard and Slasher, best of both worlds. Includes ice and radiation biome variants. ED_Spider_Gritter_Ceiling Ceiling pathfinding preference. ED_Spider_Gritter_Wall Lower health than grooter, with web spitter attack instead of acid. ED_Spider_Grooter A grunt/acid lobber hybrid which will lob ground acid spitter PRJs in a tri jaw like pattern. Mostly a proof of concept hybrid ranged/melee enemy. ED_Spider_Grooter_Ceiling Grooter with ceiling pathfinding preference, and normal acid spitter attack. ED_Spider_Grooter_Wall Hybrid melee/range grunt with wall pathfinding preference, same triple acid lob attacka as grooter. ED_Spider_Grunt_Guardian Glasher with a burrow attack tacked on, does 20% more damage than its slash. ED_Spider_Shooter_Bouncer A ground acid spitter which lobs RJ250 at you. Should do half the damage of a typical spitter prj, within 2m max damage radius. ED_Spider_Shooter_Fire An acid spitter variant which fires OG dread fireball, slightly less aggressive behavior. ED_Spider_Shooter_Ice An acid spitter variant which applies cold damage on hit, rather than the acid STE. ED_Spider_Spitter_Cyan A web spitter variant which applies the stalker shield disruption effect. ED_Spider_Spitter_Pink A web spitter variant which applies a marked-for-death status effect. ED_Spider_Spitter_Stagger A web spitter variant which applies the slasher stun effect. ED_Spider_Spitter_White A web spitter variant which does not apply any status effect. Mactera variants ED name Comments ED_Acid_Bomber Bomber variant which drops goo with properties of both sentinel goo and septic spreader goo. Its projectile attack will also leave goo behind when dodged, does a 50/50 split of poison/explosive damage rather than explosive, and applies the acid spitter STE if it hits you. ED_Arbabomber Firebomber with projectile attack replaced with arbalest mines, no visual difference from firebomber. ED_Bomber_Exploder Firebomber whose projectile attack spawns exploders, no visual difference from firebomber. spawned exploders use ED_Spider_Exploder_SpawnShot . ED_Bomber_NoShot Goo bomber with no projectile attack. ED_Enola_Gay Goo bomber that shoots nukes. ED_Mactera_IPJaw Instant penta jaw. ED_Mactera_InstaJaw Tri jaw that shoots all its projectiles at once. Currently not visually distinct from tri-jaw so I would recommend using CD2 to change materials. ED_Mactera_Pentajaw Mactera trijaw that shoots 5 projectiles instead of 3. ED_Mactera_RadialJaw Mactera that shoots in a circular pattern. ED_Mactera_Shooter_Breach and ED_Mactera_Brendle They shoot a faster version of OMEN linecutter. ED_Mactera_Trundle A hybrid of the tri-jaw and brundle. I suggest using CD2 to change its materials if you use it. ED_Parabomber Drops spawn eggs and fires an egg which applies phero STE. Greatly reduced drop rate compared to typical goober and each spawn egg spawns 1*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot. Menace variants ED name Comments ED_Spider_Fanatic A menace variant which uses the arbalest fireball fan attack, rather than normal menace attack. Long delay between attacks, and fires 5 times before reburrowing. ED_Spider_FanaticEX Original pre nerf version of Fanatic, with normal menace AI ED_Spider_ShotgunMenace Similar to the Fanatic, but fires 9 fireballs in a grid pattern, rather than 5 in a fan. ED_Spider_ShotgunMenaceEX Same for the ShotgunMenace. Spawner enemies ED name Comments ED_ShootingPlant_Spawner Fires spawn egg which spawns 6*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot. ED_ShootingPlant_SpawnerEX Same as above but also applies phero STE. ED_ShootingPlant_Spawner_Boomer Fires spawn egg which spawns 6*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Exploder_SpawnShot. ED_Spider_Shooter_Spawner A ground acid spitter which lobs dreadnaught swarmer eggs which spawn 2*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot. ED_Spider_Shooter_SpawnerEX Same as above but spawns 6*enemy count modifier. ED_Spider_Slobber A septic spreader variant which lobs deadnaught swarmer eggs which spawn 2*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot. ED_Spider_SlobberEX Same as above but spawns 6*enemy count modifier. Dreadnought variants Do not recommend allowing these to exist at the same time as vanilla twins. will lead to weird behavior of vanilla twin. These will not heal with vanilla twins or each other, but vanilla twins will try to heal with them and will grieve them. ED name Comments ED_Altnought and _Tank variant Fauxnought with slightly altered appearance and different moveset. Uses the oppressor slam instead of dread, a 3 fireball attack, and a burrow attack instead of dread fireball and swarmer egg attacks. ED_Banshee Arbalest variant that only uses grieve attack. ED_Fauxbalester Arbalester that will use both attacks. ED_Fauxbalester_Locked Arbalester that will only use mines. Technically behaves as a post heal Arbalest, but just uses mines in place of fan attack. ED_Fauxnought Non health gated dreadnought, slightly smaller than normal dread and can be stunned. Has slightly above Oppressor health and Large enemy health scaling. Eggshot spawns ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot. ED_Fauxnought_Tank A Fauxnought with stun immunity, may make some additional changes to bring more in line with dread ED_Lassie_Aggro A work around for my inability to make an unlocked lacerator without messing up the stomp attack. Trades out the fire attack for burrow. ED_Lassie_Locked A Lacerator that will not use burrow attack. Seems to really like its flamethrower attack, probably needs some tweaking. ED_Lassie_Unlocked A Lacerator that will use burrow attack. ED_Lassie_Zen A work around for my inability to make a nonhealing/grieving lacerator without messing up the stomp attack. Will not burrow after grieve sequence is triggered by killing fauxbalester/arbalester. Miscellaneous enemies ED name Comments ED_Drone_Breeder A breeder which drops homing drones (from OMEN) instead of eggs. ED_Sniper_Turret_Slow Sniper turret with 2/3rds health and 50% projectile speed, from 10x spitter projectile speed down to 5x. ED_StabberVine Stabber vines to be used as stationary enemies, might have weird behaviours. ED_SuckingPlant An unused sucking plant. Seems to be pretty buggy with the potential to give you a permanent low grav state, might try to fix it at some point.","title":"MEV, DEA and EEE"},{"location":"mev-dea/#mev-dea-and-eee","text":"MEV and DEA are two common mods that add enemies to the game.

The following is an alphabetized list of the current modules. Caps Control for the maximum number of enemies in the map, with the following fields: Field Type MaxActiveCritters Int MaxActiveEnemies Int MaxActiveSwarmers Int Example: \"Caps\": { \"MaxActiveCritters\": 40, \"MaxActiveSwarmers\": [90, 120, 180, 180], \"MaxActiveEnemies\": [90, 120, 180, 180] } When the number of enemies in the map reach their cap, new enemies will be prevented from spawning and some existing enemies will despawn. The exact mechanics behind this behaviour are not completely understood. Darkness The Darkness module offers controls related to lighting and illumination both in the Space Rig and during a mission. It has the following fields (descriptions provided by @noskill): Field Type Default Comment FlashlightStrength Float 1? Headlight light strength, affects both radius and strength of the light. PlayerIllumination Float 1? Light strength in a radius around the player. Only affects strength and not radius. FlareMax Int 4 Maximum number of flares that the player can keep.

MaxPlayers A field accepting an int specifying the maximum number of players allowed in the lobby. { \"MaxPlayers\": 16 } Name The name of the difficulty. This field is necessary to be able to save the file in the in-game CD2 dropdown. Example: { \"Name\": \"Hazard 6x2 40 nitra\" } NextDifficulty NextDifficulty allows CD2 to automatically pick another difficulty at two specific moments: When launching a mission from the space rig. When a mission is finished. There are many different uses for this field but a typical application is, using the RandomChoice mutator, choosing a difficulty at random when launching a mission: { \"Name\": \"Difficulty Roulette\", \"NextDifficulty\": { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoice\", \"Choices\": [\"6x2\", \"6x2-ultra\", \"7x2\", \"DIIa8\", \"ND\"] } } Where it is understood that all the names in the Choices field are other difficulties existing in your CD2 list. The same snippet can be used to change the difficulty at random in deep dive stages. If you don't want the difficulty to change when launching a mission from the Space Rig, the IfOnSpaceRig mutator can be used as follows: { \"NextDifficulty\": { \"Mutate\": \"IfOnSpaceRig\", \"Then\": \"\", \"Else\": \"My Next Difficulty\" } } NitraMultiplier A special module that accepts a float and controls the amount of nitra generated in the map. It has a default of 1. The following snippet would generate twice the amount of nitra in a certain mission: { \"NitraMultiplier\": 2 } Pools Pools is where enemies can be added or removed from the different pools in the game. For more information, this document is a detailed explanation about the pools system and how are they used when deciding which enemies are present in a mission. The accepted fields in Pools are: Field Type MinPoolSize Int DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount Int (min, max) StationaryEnemycount Int (min, max) CommonEnemies * SpecialEnemies * DisruptiveEnemies * StationaryPool * EnemyPool * The fields marked with * accept the Add (list), Remove (list) and Clear (bool) fields for adding and removing enemies at will. The EnemyPool can be freely manipulated with mutators during the mission, opening the possibility of adding and removing enemies based on gameplay conditions. It is not recommended to mutate the other pools. Example: { \"Pools\": { \"MinPoolSize\": 30, \"DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount\": { \"min\": 8, \"max\": 8 }, \"StationaryEnemyCount\": { \"Min\": 6, \"Max\": 6 }, \"CommonEnemies\": { \"Add\": [ \"ED_JellyBreeder_Swarm\", \"ED_PatrolBot\", \"ED_Sentinel\", \"ED_Bomber_Explosive\" ] }, \"StationaryPool\": { \"Add\": [\"ED_ShootingPlant_NukeSingle\"], \"Remove\": [] } } } Salvage A special module offering customization options for Salvage missions. It contains three submodules: MiniMules , Uplink and Refuel with the following fields: Submodule Field Type Default Description MiniMules ScanUsable Usable Settings for e holding to scan for legs MiniMules RepairUsable Usable Settings for e holding to repair the minimule MiniMules LegsRequired Int 3 Number of legs that must be attached before allowing repair MiniMules LegsPerMule Int 4 Number of legs to spawn per minimule MiniMules LegDistance Float 1500 Untested, should be distance legs spawn from the minimules MiniMules Count Int 2 Number of minimules to spawn (or 1.5x on long Salvage) MiniMules NitraToGive Int 50 Nitra given by the mules after repairing them --------- ---------------------- ------ ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Uplink RepairUsable Usable Settings for holding e to activate the uplink Uplink Scale Float 1 Size of the triangulation zone Uplink Duration Float 80 Defense duration in seconds Uplink ExtraDefenderBonus Float 0.25 Uplink DisableLeaveShout Bool false Disables mission control messages when there are no players in the defense area. Uplink LeavePenaltyMultiplier Float 1 1 means vanilla penalty (2x the speed progress normally increases) --------- ---------------------- ------ ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Refuel RepairUsable Usable Refuel Scale Float 1 Size of the triangulation zone Refuel Duration Float 100 Defense duration in seconds Refuel ExtraDefenderBonus Float 0.25 Refuel DisableLeaveShout Bool false Refuel LeavePenaltyMultiplier Float 1 0 means no lost progress if leaving the defense area Example: a salvage where each mule spawns 20 legs and requires 15 to be repaired, and the area of the uplink bubble is 1.5x the normal. { \"Salvage\": { \"MiniMules\": { \"LegsPerMule\": 20, \"LegsRequired\": 15 }, \"Uplink\": { \"Scale\": 1.5 } } } Please see the BySalvagePhase mutator for values that need to change during different phases of the mission. SpecialEncounters This module controls the chance of some random events such as the Korlok, Bet-C, etc. Please note that this module is not 100 % functional as some of the encounters depend on the seasons system which CD2 cannot control for now. Each SpecialEncounter accepts the following fields: Field Type BaseChance Float Enemy Descriptor CanSpawnInDeepDive Bool The vanilla SpecialEncounters would look like: { \"SpecialEncounters\": [ { \"Enemy\": \"ED_InfectedMule\", \"BaseChance\": 0.05, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": true }, { \"Enemy\": \"ED_Spider_ExploderTank_King\", \"BaseChance\": 0.03, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": false }, { \"Enemy\": \"ED_HydraWeed\", \"BaseChance\": 0.05, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": false }, { \"Enemy\": \"ED_Terminator\", \"BaseChance\": 0.03, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": true } ] } Example: set all special encounters to zero. { \"SpecialEncounters\": [] } SpecialEncounters can accept any enemy descriptor in its Enemy field and it can be used to make sure there's exactly 1 such enemy for the whole mission. As an example, some difficulties have exactly 1 Vartok Scalebramble per mission: { \"SpecialEncounters\": [ { \"BaseChance\": 1.0, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": true, \"Enemy\": \"ED_TentaclePlant\" } ] } Resupply This module contains information about the resupply cost. It accepts a single float field Cost that can be mutated . Example: a fixed resupply cost of 40 nitra. { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": 40 } } The StartingNitra field from CD1 does not exist in CD2: the same functionality is done with mutators. Example: the first resupply is free, 40 nitra for all others: { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": { \"Mutate\": \"ByResuppliesCalled\", \"Values\": [0, 40] } } } { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\" }, \"==\": 0, \"Then\": 0, \"Else\": 40 } } } While both snippets do the same thing, ByResuppliesCalled is usually more compact when specifying a different cost for the first few supplies. Example: the cost is 45, but after the 6th resupply it drops to 40. { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\" }, \">\": 6, \"Then\": 40, \"Else\": 45 } } } Warnings The Warnings module can be used to ban mission anomalies. It accepts a single Banned field which is one or more from the following table: CD2 name In-game name \"MMUT_BloodSugar\" Blood Sugar \"MMUT_ExplosiveEnemies\" Volatile Guts \"MMUT_ExterminationContract\" Golden Bugs \"MMUT_GoldRush\" Gold Rush \"MMUT_LowGravity\" Low Gravity \"MMUT_OxygenRich\" Rich Atmosphere \"MMUT_RichInMinerals\" Mineral Mania \"MMUT_SecretSecondary\" Secret Secondary \"MMUT_Weakspot\" Critical Weakness \"MMUT_XXXP\" Double XP \"WRN_BulletHell\" Duck and Cover \"WRN_CaveLeechDen\" Cave Leech Cluster \"WRN_ExploderInfestation\" Exploder Infestation \"WRN_Ghost\" Haunted Cave \"WRN_HeroEnemies\" Elite Enemies \"WRN_InfestedEnemies\" Parasites \"WRN_LethalEnemies\" Lethal Enemies \"WRN_MacteraCave\" Mactera Plague \"WRN_NoOxygen\" Low O2 \"WRN_NoShields\" Shield Disruption \"WRN_Plague\" Lithophage Outbreak \"WRN_RegenerativeEnemies\" Regenerative Enemies \"WRN_RivalIncursion\" Rival Presence \"WRN_RockInfestation\" Ebonite Outbreak \"WRN_Swarmagedon Swarmageddon Example: ban Swarmageddon and Low O2 from a difficulty. { \"Warnings\": { \"Banned\": [ \"WRN_Swarmagedon\", \"WRN_NoOxygen\" ] } } WaveSpawners See the WaveSpawners section.","title":"Modules"},{"location":"modules/#modules","text":"Modules are the top level hierarchy names for a valid CD2 JSON.

Accumulate Accumulate can track changes in other mutators by adding to a starting Initial number. In addition, it also supports clamping the accumulated value with Min and Max . If used with a constant value, it can be used to make a simple counter. Example: the value of the following snippet starts at 0 and would cap at 10 after roughly 10 seconds. { \"Mutate\": \"Accumulate\", \"Initial\": 0, \"Value\": 1, \"Min\": 0, \"Max\": 10 } Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Pow, Modulo, Round, Ceil, Floor Arithmetic mutators that can be used for basic mathematical operations. Example: enemy speed as a linear function of resupplies called during the mission. \"SpeedModifier\": { \"Mutate\": \"Add\", \"A\": 1.35, \"B\": { \"Mutate\": \"Multiply\", \"A\": { \"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\" }, \"B\": 0.1 } } And, Or, Not Basic boolean operators. ByBiome Change the value based on the mission biome. If a value isn't set for a biome it will use the 'Default' value. A 'Default' must be set unless a value is specified for biomes. If a biome is not recognized and no default is specified, the value for CrystallineCaverns will be used. Official name Alias 1 Alias 2 BIOME_AzureWeald AzureWeald BIOME_CrystalCaves CrystalCaves CrystallineCaverns BIOME_FungusBogs FungusBogs BIOME_HollowBough HollowBough BIOME_IceCaves IceCaves GlacialStrata BIOME_MagmaCaves MagmaCaves MagmaCore BIOME_SandblastedCorridors SandblastedCorridors Sandblasted BIOME_RadioactiveZone RadioactiveExclusionZone REZ BIOME_SaltCaves SaltCaves SaltPits ByDDStage Change the value based on the Deep Dive stage. If a value isn't set for a stage, it will use the 'Default' value. A 'Default' must be set. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByDDStage\", \"Default\": 1.2, \"Stage1\": 1.0, \"Stage2\": 1.2, \"Stage3\": 1.45 } ByDNA Allows setting a value based on a combination of Mission Type, Length, and Complexity: { \"Mutate\": \"ByDNA\", \"Default\": 1, \"Mining\": 2, \"Refinery\": 3, \"Refinery,x,2\": 5, \"Refinery,2\": 4, \"x,x,2\": 8 } The condition with the most matches will be prioritized. Mission type is prioritized over length and length over complexity. An \u201cx\u201d matches anything. In the above a (2,2) refinery would have the value 4. ByEscortPhase Used to detect the different stages of an Escort mission: { \"Mutate\": \"ByEscortPhase\", \"Default\": 0, \"InGarage\": 0.1, \"Stationary\": 2, \"Moving\": 30, \"WaitingForFuel\": 400, \"FinalEventA\": 5, \"FinalEventB\": 0.6, \"FinalEventC\": 70, \"FinalEventD\": 8, \"Finished\": 900 } ByMissionType Change the value based on mission type. If a value isn't set for a mission type it will use the 'Default' value. A 'Default' must be set unless a value is specified for all mission types. Supported mission types: DeepScan Egg Elimination Escort Mining PE Refinery Sabotage Salvage Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByMissionType\", \"Default\": 60, \"Egg\": 70, \"PE\": 80 } BySecondary Can be used to detect secondary objectives both on normal missions and on deep dives. The objectives have the following names: Name OBJ_2nd_Mine_Dystrum OBJ_2nd_Mine_Hollomite OBJ_2nd_KillFleas OBJ_2nd_Find_Gunkseed OBJ_2nd_Find_Fossil OBJ_2nd_Find_Ebonut OBJ_2nd_Find_BooloCap OBJ_2nd_Find_ApocaBloom OBJ_2nd_DestroyEggs OBJ_2nd_DestroyBhaBarnacles OBJ_DD_RepairMinimules OBJ_DD_Defense OBJ_DD_DeepScan OBJ_DD_Morkite OBJ_DD_Elimination_Eggs OBJ_DD_AlienEggs OBJ_DD_MorkiteWell Example: change the Nitra multiplier depending on the secondary objective in deep dives (20 % more nitra on dreadnought and black box objectives). { \"NitraMultiplier\": { \"Mutate\": \"BySecondary\", \"OBJ_DD_Elimination_Eggs\": 1.2, \"OBJ_DD_Defense\": 1.2 } } ByTime Change a value over time. Time matches the mission clock in the escape menu in-game, including starting before players receive control of their dwarves. The value is determined by InitialValue + RateOfChange * Max(0, Time - StartDelay) . Parameters: InitialValue - Value at time 0 and up until StartDelay StartDelay - Time in seconds to stay at the InitialValue before changing. RateOfChange - Rate per second to change the value. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByTime\", \"InitialValue\": 3.1, \"RateOfChange\": 0.0033, \"StartDelay\": 400 } ByPlayerCount Change the value based on the number of players in-game. A solo game gets the first position in the list; two players get the second spot and so on. The last value in the list is used if there are more players than there are values in the list. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByPlayerCount\", \"Values\": [ 80, 120, 180, 180 ] } ByRefineryPhase Used to detect the different stages of a Refinery mission. { \"Mutate\": \"ByRefineryPhase\", \"Default\": 0, \"Landing\": 1, \"ConnectingPipes\": 2, \"PipesConnected\": 3, \"Refining\": 4, \"RefiningStalled\": 5, \"RefiningComplete\": 6, \"RocketLaunched\": 7 } ByResuppliesCalled Allows specifying an array with indexes 0, 1, 2, etc, where the values at each index become valid when the number of resupplies corresponding to said index have been called. The most typical use is specifying a varying number of resupply costs. For example: { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": { \"Mutate\": \"ByResuppliesCalled\", \"Values\": [40, 50, 60] } } } will set up the first resupply to be 40 nitra, the second to be 50 nitra and 60 for all subsequent supplies. BySaboPhase Used to detect the different stages of a Sabotage mission. { \"Mutate\": \"BySaboPhase\", \"Default\": \"Default Value\", \"Hacking\": \"Hacking Value\", \"BetweenHacks\": \"BetweenHacks Value\", \"HackingFinished\": \"HackingFinished Value\", \"Phase1Vent\": \"Phase1VentValue\", \"Phase1Eye\": \"Value for Phase1Eye\", \"Phase2Vent\": \"Value for Phase2Vent\", \"Phase2Eye\": \"Value for Phase2Eye\", \"Phase3Vent\": \"Phase3Vent Value\", \"Phase3Eye\": \"Value to use during Phase3Eye\", \"Finished\": \"Value for Finished\" } BySalvagePhase Used to detect the different stages of a Salvage mission. The mutator uses the Default value for any mission that is not Salvage. { \"Mutate\": \"BySalvagePhase\", \"Default\": \"Default Value\", \"Mules\": \"Value until all mules repaired\", \"PreUplink\": \"Value while mules finished but uplink not started\", \"Uplink\": \"Value during the uplink event\", \"PreRefuel\": \"Value between defense events\", \"Refuel\": \"Value during the refuel event\", \"Finished\": \"Value for the remainder of the mission\" } Clamp Constrain a float (number) to fall within a range. This range is inclusive. If only a min or only a max is specified, the value will only be clamped in that direction. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"Clamp\", \"Value\": 90, \"Min\": 0, \"Max\": 100 } DefenseProgress This mutator tracks the progress of a defense event such as a black box, refuel or uplink. It returns a float between [0, 1] starting at 0.3. Delta Delta can be used to detect a change in some other variable or mutator, and it is often used with Accumulate . Example: The following snippet will become momentarily true when a player receives health or shield damage. { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"Delta\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"Add\", \"A\": { \"Mutate\": \"DwarvesHealth\" }, \"B\": { \"Mutate\": \"DwarvesShield\" } } }, \"<\": 0, \"Then\": true, \"Else\": false } DepositedResource Count of a resource that has been deposited into the team depository. Any resource can be referenced by the name as it appears in the in-game UI. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"DepositedResource\", \"Resource\": \"Nitra\" } DescriptorExists This is a boolean value which reflects whether an enemy descriptor is available. This is intended to allow a difficulty to fall back to a different descriptor if the desired descriptor isn't available, e.g. if MEV is not available. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": { \"Mutate\": \"DescriptorExists\", \"ED\": \"ED_MEV_Enemy\" }, \"Then\": [\"ED_MEV_Enemy\"], \"Else\": [\"ED_Backup\"] } DrillerCount Number of drillers in the lobby. DuringDefend Becomes true when a black box, uplink or cell refuel is active. DuringDread Becomes true whenever there is one of the following descriptors active on the map: ED_Spider_Boss_Heavy (Hiveguard), ED_Spider_Boss_TwinA (Arbalest), ED_Spider_Boss_TwinB (Lacerator) and ED_Spider_Tank_Boss (classic Dreadnought). DuringDrillevator Becomes true during the elevator phase in a Deep Scan mission. DuringEggAmbush Returns True during a non-announced wave after pulling an egg in Egg Hunts. DuringEncounters Becomes true when Encounters are being placed in the map, that is, during mission generation. One of its uses it to change descriptor properties depending on whether they are part of an encounter or not: { \"Enemies\": { \"ED_Spider_Exploder\": { \"Base\": \"ED_Spider_Exploder\", \"CanBeUsedForConstantPressure\": true, \"CanBeUsedInEncounters\": true, \"DifficultyRating\": 10, \"Rarity\": { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": { \"Mutate\": \"DuringEncounters\" }, \"Then\": 0.1, \"Else\": 5.5 } } } } The snippet will force exploders in almost all encounters by giving them a very low rarity during those. Clearing the EnemyPool when DuringEncounters is true will remove encounters from the mission. DuringExtraction Becomes true during the extraction phase of the mission, ie, when going back to the drop pod. DuringGenericSwarm Becomes true during a swarm announced by Mission Control. DuringMission This is true during a mission, or true during a specific window of time during a mission if times are specified. If specified, StartingAt determines the elapsed mission time in seconds when this becomes true. If specified, StoppingAfter determines the elapsed mission time in seconds after which this is false. Example: Only add stalkers and elite guards to the pool after 240 seconds have elapsed in the mission. \"EnemyPool\"{ \"add\" { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": {\"Mutate\": \"DuringMission\", \"StartingAt\": 240}, \"Then\": [\"ED_Spider_Stalker\", \"ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard_Elite\"], \"Else\": [] } } DuringPECountdown Returns True during the extraction phase of a PE mission. DwarfCount Returns the number of players in the mission. DwarvesAmmo Average percent ammo left for the team, 1 when all teammates have 100% of their ammo and 0 when all teammates are at 0% ammo. This works the same way as the 4 bars under the dwarves names in the UI. DwarvesDown Float count of the dwarves that are currently down, 0 if no dwarves are currently downed, 4 if all 4 dwarves are down. DwarvesDownTime Time in seconds that has elapsed while a dwarf has been down. If multiple dwarves are down, it's the longest time down among the downed dwarves. DwarvesDowns Total number of downs for the team during the mission. This might not match the end screen because it will still count downs from disconnected players, and will not over-count downs. DwarvesHealth Average health, 1 when all teammates are at 100% health and 0 when all teammates are down. DwarvesRevives Total number of revives for the team during the mission. This includes IW self-revives. DwarvesShield Average shields, 1 when all teammates are at full shield 0 when all teammates are at 0 shield. Untested on shield disruption. ElapsedExtraction Returns the elapsed time in the extraction phase of a mission. EnemiesKilled Count number of Enemies that have died this mission. Optionally, this can get the deaths of a specific enemy descriptor. Despawned enemies because of caps are likely counted. If your difficulty despawns significant amounts of enemies, this number might not match expectations. Examples: Count of all enemy kills: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemiesKilled\" } Count of enemies that have died with a specific descriptor: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemiesKilled\", \"ED\": \"ED_Spider_Grunt\" } EnemyCooldown EnemyCount Count the number of enemies currently alive on the map. Optionally, this can get the count of a specific enemy descriptor. It's possible for this monitor to drift slightly from the actual count if base game events don't fire, but it should always be correct. Examples: Count all enemies on the map: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemyCount\" } Count of enemies with a specific descriptor: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemyCount\", \"ED\": \"ED_Spider_Grunt\" } EngineerCount Number of engineers in the lobby. GunnerCount Number of gunners in the lobby. HeldResource For a resource, the sum of that resource in players' inventories, not deposited. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"HeldResource\", \"Resource\": \"Apoca Bloom\" } IWsLeft Float count of the number of IWs the team still has in reserve, 0 when no IWs remain. This will be 0 until dwarves are spawned which happens after the level is setup including encounters and terrain. If Check a boolean condition, \"Condition\", and select either \"Then\" or \"Else\". The condition is usually another mutator that returns a boolean value. Example: Remove a fast bulk from the pool during a defense objective. { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": {\"Mutate\": \"DuringDefend\"}, \"Then\": [], \"Else\": [\"ED_Fast_Bulk\"] } IfFloat Choose one value or another based on a comparison of two float values. The two floats are specified by 'Value' and the operator to be used e.g. '>=' if the comparison was to be greater than or equal. If the condition is true the 'Then' value is used, else the 'Else' condition is used. Valid operators are: ==, >=, >, <=, < Example: as long as the team has called less than 2 resupplies the value is 40. After the team has called their second resupply, the value is 80. { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": {\"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\"}, \"<\": 2, \"Then\": 40, \"Else\": 80 } IfOnSpaceRig Returns True on the Space Rig. Max Returns the maximum of a value. Min Returns the minimum of a value. RandomChoice Given an array of choices, choose one at random. It accepts an optional second list with weights for a weighted sampling of the choices. Example: add either arbalests or lacerators to the enemy pool with a higher chance for arbalests. { \"EnemyPool\"{ \"add\" { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoice\", \"Choices\": [\"ED_Spider_Boss_TwinA\", \"ED_Spider_Boss_TwinB\"], \"Weights\": [0.6, 0.4] } } } RandomChoicePerMission Choose one of a set of values for each mission. The choice is fixed to the seed of the mission. Subsequent plays of the same seed will use the same value. This mutator can be used with just Choices . In that case it will uniformly sample from the choices. Optionally, a second list Weights provides weights for weighted sampling of the choices. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoicePerMission\", \"Choices\": [ \"bedrock\", \"hotrock\", \"dirt\" ] } The following will be false 95 % of the time: { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoicePerMission\", \"Choices\": [ false, true ], \"Weights\": [ 95, 5 ] } ResupplyUsesLeft The count among all supply pods of uses left on a resupply. By default, resupplies start with 4 uses. Caveat: the counts goes up immediately when a resupply is called, before it lands. ResuppliesCalled Number of resupplies the team has called during the mission. This should increment almost immediately after a resupply is initiated, before another resupply can be called. ResupplyUsesConsumed The number of uses that have been consumed from resupplies this mission. ScoutCount Number of scouts in the lobby. SquareWave Alternates between two values with a given period. Example: Add and remove stalkers on alternating periods of 250 seconds. { \"EnemyPool\": { \"clear\": false, \"add\": [ { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"SquareWave\", \"Period\": 250, \"High\": 1, \"Low\": 0 }, \">\": 0.5, \"Then\": [\"ED_Spider_Stalker\"], \"Else\": [] } ], \"remove\": [ { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"SquareWave\", \"Period\": 250, \"High\": 1, \"Low\": 0 }, \">\": 0.5, \"Then\": [], \"Else\": [\"ED_Spider_Stalker\"] } ], } } TimeDelta Change a value over time. Time matches the mission clock in the escape menu in-game, including starting before players receive control of their dwarves. The value is determined by InitialValue + RateOfChange * Max(0, Time - StartDelay) . Parameters: InitialValue : Value at time 0 and up until StartDelay StartDelay : Time in seconds to stay at the InitialValue before changing. RateOfChange : Rate per second to change the value. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"TimeDelta\", \"InitialValue\": 3.1, \"RateOfChange\": 0.0033, \"StartDelay\": 400 } TotalResource Sum of a resource held in players inventories and the group depot.

The following basic example spawns a wave of difficulty 100 composed of only grunts every 90 seconds in 3 locations around the player: { \"WaveSpawners\": { \"Enabled\": true, \"Interval\": 90, \"Enemies\": [\"ED_Spider_Grunt\"], \"Difficulty\": 100, \"Distance\": 10, \"Locations\": 3 } } The following table shows the valid fields inside a WaveSpawner : Field Type Description Enabled Bool Whether the wave spawner is active (True) or not (False). Name String A description. Doesn't have any effect. Interval Float After the wave is enabled, a time of Interval seconds will pass until the first spawns appear unless SpawnOnEnable (see below) is True. After that the wave will repeat every Interval seconds unless disabled. Enemies [List] A list of the enemy descriptors that will spawn. To spawn all available enemies in the pool, leave the field empty. Difficulty Float Number of points assigned to the wave event, which will be distributed among the enemies in Enemies depending on their DifficultyRating to decide how many will spawn. Distance Float Distance where the enemies will spawn relative to the player. Locations Int Number of spawn points. SpawnOnEnable Bool If True, the wave will start spawning enemies as soon as it is enabled, skipping the initial Interval . Defaults to False. UnlockInterval Bool If true, changing the interval will modify the current timer. If false, the time to next spawn is selected once and locked to that time until rerolled (e.g. when enemies spawn). Defaults to False. PauseOnDisable Bool If true, the timer for the next spawn is paused while the wavespawner is disabled and resumes when it is enabled. If false, the timer is reset when the spawner is re-enabled. Defaults to False. All WaveSpawner fields can be mutated.
