The files for your difficulties can be pasted and edited in the text box. After clicking Save , the file will be saved based on the name in the Name top level field; if the file already existed, it will be overwritten. Difficulties get saved inside your mod config. You can check all your difficulties by clicking on the drop-down menu. The Reset button sets a difficulty as a default upon starting the game. The CD2 files CD2 files are in the JSON format. CD1 files are not compatible with CD2. The top level fields of the file are modules with different functionalities. If a module or a field is missing from a CD2 file, the value from the BaseHazard for the file is taken. The BaseHazard can be specified inside the DifficultySetting module. If none is specified, the base hazard is Hazard 5. A file that is just {} represents vanilla Hazard 5. Most fields that admit floats or ints accept also an array of the same type: { \"Caps\": { \"MaxActiveEnemies\": [90, 120, 180, 180] } } which means that MaxActiveEnemies scales with the number of players, 1 to 4, with the values specified inside. The arrays can be as large as desired to accomodate for 4+ player lobbies: { \"Caps\": { \"MaxActiveEnemies\": [90, 120, 180, 180, 210, 210, 240, 240] } } If the lobby has more players than indices in the array, the last value is used. Most fields can change based on gameplay conditions using mutators . The best way to learn how to use them is to look at already existing difficulties and trying to understand what they do.

A: The mod right now is in open beta and the .pak file can be found in the Practical DRG discord server. The mod integration loader is recommended. Q: Can I use this at the same time as CD1? A: No. Only enable one CD version at a time. Q: How can I use this? A: Drag and drop the zip file into MINT and press install mods. You do not need to extract the pak from the zip to install. Q: Do clients need CD2 to play in my CD2 lobby? A: Clients only need CD2 if you use certain features. For instance, difficulties that use the Enemies module will require that all clients have CD2. If the EnemiesNoSync is used instead, clients will no longer need CD2. Q: Why aren't my original cd difficulties compatible with CD2? A: Custom Difficulty v2 is a complete redesign. It uses top level names to denote independent modules. For this reason, many previous top-level fields were moved into modules. Q: Does CD2 support more than 4 players? A: Yes CD2 has complete support for more than 4 player lobbies. Any player-count depedent field can be extended to any number of players. Additionally, you can specify MaxPlayers: 8 in your difficulty to set the max players count. Q: Will changing the difficulty mid mission break the game like in CD1?

PST_RadiationResistance Float 0.5 Currently unsupported. PST_ExplosionResistance Float 0.5 Currently unsupported. MaxPlayers A field accepting an int specifying the maximum number of players allowed in the lobby. { `MaxPlayers`: 16 } Name The name of the difficulty. Example: { \"Name\": \"Hazard 6x2 40 nitra\" } NextDifficulty NextDifficulty allows CD2 to automatically pick another difficulty at two specific moments: When launching a mission from the space rig. When a mission is finished. There are many different uses for this field but a typical application is, using the RandomChoice mutator, choosing a difficulty at random when launching a mission: { \"Name\": \"Difficulty Roulette\", \"NextDifficulty\": { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoice\", \"Choices\": [\"6x2\", \"6x2-ultra\", \"7x2\", \"DIIa8\", \"ND\"] } } Where it is understood that all the names in the Choices field are other difficulties existing in your CD2 list. The same snippet can be used to change the difficulty at random in deep dive stages. If you don't want the difficulty to change when launching a mission from the Space Rig, the IfOnSpaceRig mutator can be used as follows: { \"NextDifficulty\": { \"Mutate\": \"IfOnSpaceRig\", \"Then\": \"\", \"Else\": \"My Next Difficulty\" } } NitraMultiplier A special module that accepts a float and controls the amount of nitra generated in the map. It has a default of 1. The following snippet would generate twice the amount of nitra in a certain mission: { \"NitraMultiplier\": 2 } Pools Pools is where enemies can be added or removed from the different pools in the game. For more information, this document is a detailed explanation about the pools system and how are they used when deciding which enemies are present in a mission. The accepted fields in Pools are: Field Type MinPoolSize Int DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount Int (min, max) StationaryEnemycount Int (min, max) CommonEnemies * SpecialEnemies * DisruptiveEnemies * StationaryPool * EnemyPool * The fields marked with * accept the Add (list), Remove (list) and Clear (bool) fields for adding and removing enemies at will. The pools can be freely manipulated with mutators during the mission, opening the possibility of adding and removing enemies based on gameplay conditions. Example: { \"Pools\": { \"MinPoolSize\": 30, \"DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount\": { \"min\": 8, \"max\": 8 }, \"StationaryEnemyCount\": { \"Min\": 6, \"Max\": 6 }, \"CommonEnemies\": { \"Add\": [ \"ED_JellyBreeder_Swarm\", \"ED_PatrolBot\", \"ED_Sentinel\", \"ED_Bomber_Explosive\" ] }, \"StationaryPool\": { \"Add\": [\"ED_ShootingPlant_NukeSingle\"], \"Remove\": [] } } } SpecialEncounters This module controls the chance of some random events such as the Korlok, Bet-C, etc. Please note that this module is not 100 % functional as some of the encounters depend on the seasons system which CD2 cannot control for now. Each SpecialEncounter accepts the following fields: Field Type BaseChance Float Enemy Descriptor CanSpawnInDeepDive Bool The vanilla SpecialEncounters would look like: { \"SpecialEncounters\": [ { \"Enemy\": \"ED_InfectedMule\", \"BaseChance\": 0.05, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": true }, { \"Enemy\": \"ED_Spider_ExploderTank_King\", \"BaseChance\": 0.03, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": false }, { \"Enemy\": \"ED_HydraWeed\", \"BaseChance\": 0.05, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": false }, { \"Enemy\": \"ED_Terminator\", \"BaseChance\": 0.03, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": true } ] } Example: set all special encounters to zero. { \"SpecialEncounters\": [] } SpecialEncounters can accept any enemy descriptor in its Enemy field and it can be used to make sure there's exactly 1 such enemy for the whole mission. As an example, some difficulties have exactly 1 Vartok Scalebramble per mission: { \"SpecialEncounters\": [ { \"BaseChance\": 1.0, \"CanSpawnInDeepDive\": true, \"Enemy\": \"ED_TentaclePlant\" } ] } Resupply This module contains information about the resupply cost. It accepts a single float field Cost that can be mutated . Example: a fixed resupply cost of 40 nitra. { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": 40 } } Example: the first resupply is free, 40 nitra for all others. { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\" }, \"==\": 0, \"Then\": 0, \"Else\": 40 } } } Example: the cost is 45, but after the 6th resupply it drops to 40. { \"Resupply\": { \"Cost\": { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\" }, \">\": 6, \"Then\": 40, \"Else\": 45 } } } Warnings The Warnings module can be used to ban mission anomalies.

Accumulate Accumulate can track changes in other mutators by adding to a starting Initial number. In addition, it also supports clamping the accumulated value with Min and Max . If used with a constant value, it can be used to make a simple counter. Example: the value of the following snippet starts at 0 and would cap at 10 after roughly 10 seconds. { \"Mutate\": \"Accumulate\", \"Initial\": 0, \"Value\": 1, \"Min\": 0, \"Max\": 10 } Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Pow, Modulo, Round, Ceil, Floor Arithmetic mutators that can be used for basic mathematical operations. Example: enemy speed as a linear function of resupplies called during the mission. \"SpeedModifier\": { \"Mutate\": \"Add\", \"A\": 1.35, \"B\": { \"Mutate\": \"Multiply\", \"A\": { \"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\" }, \"B\": 0.1 } } And, Or, Not Basic boolean operators. ByBiome Change the value based on the mission biome. If a value isn't set for a biome it will use the 'Default' value. A 'Default' must be set unless a value is specified for biomes. If a biome is not recognized and no default is specified, the value for CrystallineCaverns will be used.

If a value isn't set for a stage, it will use the 'Default' value. A 'Default' must be set. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByDDStage\", \"Default\": 1.2, \"Stage1\": 1.0, \"Stage2\": 1.2, \"Stage3\": 1.45 } ByDNA Allows setting a value based on a combination of Mission Type, Length, and Complexity: { \"Mutate\": \"ByDNA\", \"Default\": 1, \"Mining\": 2, \"Refinery\": 3, \"Refinery,x,2\": 5, \"Refinery,2\": 4, \"x,x,2\": 8 } The condition with the most matches will be prioritized. Mission type is prioritized over length and length over complexity. An \u201cx\u201d matches anything. In the above a (2,2) refinery would have the value 4. ByEscortPhase Used to detect the different stages of an Escort mission: { \"Mutate\": \"ByEscortPhase\", \"Default\": 0, \"InGarage\": 0.1, \"Stationary\": 2, \"Moving\": 30, \"WaitingForFuel\": 400, \"FinalEventA\": 5, \"FinalEventB\": 0.6, \"FinalEventC\": 70, \"FinalEventD\": 8, \"Finished\": 900 } ByMissionType Change the value based on mission type. If a value isn't set for a mission type it will use the 'Default' value. A 'Default' must be set unless a value is specified for all mission types. Supported mission types: DeepScan Egg Elimination Escort Mining PE Refinery Sabotage Salvage Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByMissionType\", \"Default\": 60, \"Egg\": 70, \"PE\": 80 } ByTime ByPlayerCount Change the value based on the number of players in-game. A solo game gets the first position in the list; two players get the second spot and so on. The last value in the list is used if there are more players than there are values in the list. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"ByPlayerCount\", \"Values\": [ 80, 120, 180, 180 ] } ByRefineryPhase Used to detect the different stages of a Refinery mission. { \"Mutate\": \"ByRefineryPhase\", \"Default\": 0, \"Landing\": 1, \"ConnectingPipes\": 2, \"PipesConnected\": 3, \"Refining\": 4, \"RefiningStalled\": 5, \"RefiningComplete\": 6, \"RocketLaunched\": 7 } Clamp Constrain a float (number) to fall within a range. This range is inclusive. If only a min or only a max is specified, the value will only be clamped in that direction. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"Clamp\", \"Value\": 90, \"Min\": 0, \"Max\": 100 } Delta Delta can be used to detect a change in some other variable or mutator, and it is often used with Accumulate . Example: The following snippet will become momentarily true when a player receives health or shield damage. { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"Delta\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"Add\", \"A\": { \"Mutate\": \"DwarvesHealth\" }, \"B\": { \"Mutate\": \"DwarvesShield\" } } }, \"<\": 0, \"Then\": true, \"Else\": false } DepositedResource Count of a resource that has been deposited into the team depository. Any resource can be referenced by the name as it appears in the in-game UI. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"DepositedResource\", \"Resource\": \"Nitra\" } DescriptorExists This is a boolean value which reflects whether an enemy descriptor is available. This is intended to allow a difficulty to fall back to a different descriptor if the desired descriptor isn't available, e.g. if MEV is not available. Exammple: { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": { \"Mutate\": \"DescriptorExists\", \"ED\": \"ED_MEV_Enemy\" }, \"Then\": [\"ED_MEV_Enemy\"], \"Else\": [\"ED_Backup\"] } DrillerCount Number of drillers in the lobby. DuringDefend Becomes true when a black box, uplink or cell refuel is active. DuringDread Becomes true whenever there is one of the following descriptors active on the map: ED_Spider_Boss_Heavy (Hiveguard), ED_Spider_Boss_TwinA (Arbalest), ED_Spider_Boss_TwinB (Lacerator) and ED_Spider_Tank_Boss (classic Dreadnought). DuringDrillevator Becomes true during the elevator phase in a Deep Scan mission. DuringEggAmbush Returns True during a non-announced wave after pulling an egg in Egg Hunts. DuringEncounters Becomes true when an encounter (a special kind of wave that happens when breaching rooms in certain mission types) is happening. DuringExtraction Becomes true during the extraction phase of the mission, ie, when going back to the drop pod. DuringGenericSwarm Becomes true during a swarm announced by Mission Control. DuringMission This is true during a mission, or true during a specific window of time during a mission if times are specified. If specified, StartingAt determines the elapsed mission time in seconds when this becomes true. If specified, StoppingAfter determines the elapsed mission time in seconds after which this is false. Example: Only add stalkers and elite guards to the pool after 240 seconds have elapsed in the mission. \"EnemyPool\"{ \"add\" { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": {\"Mutate\": \"DuringMission\", \"StartingAfter\": 240}, \"Then\": [\"ED_Spider_Stalker\", \"ED_Spider_Grunt_Guard_Elite\"], \"Else\": [] } } DuringPECountdown Returns True during the extraction phase of a PE mission. DwarvesAmmo Average percent ammo left for the team, 1 when all teammates have 100% of their ammo and 0 when all teammates are at 0% ammo. This works the same way as the 4 bars under the dwarves names in the UI. DwarvesDown Float count of the dwarves that are currently down, 0 if no dwarves are currently downed, 4 if all 4 dwarves are down. DwarvesDownTime Time in seconds that has elapsed while a dwarf has been down. If multiple dwarves are down, it's the longest time down among the downed dwarves. DwarvesDowns Total number of downs for the team during the mission. This might not match the end screen because it will still count downs from disconnected players, and will not over-count downs. DwarvesHealth Average health, 1 when all teammates are at 100% health and 0 when all teammates are down. DwarvesRevives Total number of revives for the team during the mission. This includes IW self-revives. DwarvesShield Average shields, 1 when all teammates are at full shield 0 when all teammates are at 0 shield. Untested on shield disruption. ElapsedExtraction Returns the elapsed time in the extraction phase of a mission. EnemiesKilled Count number of Enemies that have died this mission. Optionally, this can get the deaths of a specific enemy descriptor. Despawned enemies because of caps are likely counted. If your difficulty despawns significant amounts of enemies, this number might not match expectations. Examples: Count of all enemy kills: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemiesKilled\" } Count of enemies that have died with a specific descriptor: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemiesKilled\", \"ED\": \"ED_Spider_Grunt\" } EnemyCooldown EnemyCount Count the number of enemies currently alive on the map. Optionally, this can get the count of a specific enemy descriptor. It's possible for this monitor to drift slightly from the actual count if base game events don't fire, but it should always be correct. Examples: Count all enemies on the map: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemyCount\" } Count of enemies with a specific descriptor: { \"Mutate\": \"EnemyCount\", \"ED\": \"ED_Spider_Grunt\" } EngineerCount Number of engineers in the lobby. GunnerCount Number of gunners in the lobby. HeldResource For a resource, the sum of that resource in players' inventories, not deposited. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"HeldResource\", \"Resource\": \"Apoca Bloom\" } IWsLeft Float count of the number of IWs the team still has in reserve, 0 when no IWs remain. This will be 0 until dwarves are spawned which happens after the level is setup including encounters and terrain. If Check a boolean condition, \"Condition\", and select either \"Then\" or \"Else\". The condition is usually another mutator that returns a boolean value. Example: Remove a fast bulk from the pool during a defense objective. { \"Mutate\": \"If\", \"Condition\": {\"Mutate\": \"DuringDefend\"}, \"Then\": [], \"Else\": [\"ED_Fast_Bulk\"] } IfFloat Choose one value or another based on a comparison of two float values. The two floats are specified by 'Value' and the operator to be used e.g. '>=' if the comparison was to be greater than or equal. If the condition is true the 'Then' value is used, else the 'Else' condition is used. Valid operators are: ==, >=, >, <=, < Example: as long as the team has called less than 2 resupplies the value is 40. After the team has called their second resupply, the value is 80. { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": {\"Mutate\": \"ResuppliesCalled\"}, \"<\": 2, \"Then\": 40, \"Else\": 80 } IfOnSpaceRig Returns True on the Space Rig. RandomChoice Given an array of choices, choose one at random. It accepts an optional second list with weights for a weighted sampling of the choices. Example: add either arbalests or lacerators to the enemy pool with a higher chance for arbalests. { \"EnemyPool\"{ \"add\" { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoice\", \"Choices\": [\"ED_Spider_Boss_TwinA\", \"ED_Spider_Boss_TwinB\"], \"Weights\": [0.6, 0.4] } } } Max Returns the maximum of a value. Min Returns the minimum of a value. RandomChoicePerMission Choose one of a set of values for each mission. The choice is fixed to the seed of the mission. Subsequent plays of the same seed will use the same value. This mutator can be used with just Choices . In that case it will uniformly sample from the choices. Optionally, a second list Weights provides weights for weighted sampling of the choices. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoicePerMission\", \"Choices\": [ \"bedrock\", \"hotrock\", \"dirt\" ] } The following will be false 95 % of the time: { \"Mutate\": \"RandomChoicePerMission\", \"Choices\": [ false, true ], \"Weights\": [ 95, 5 ] } ResupplyUsesLeft The count among all supply pods of uses left on a resupply. By default, resupplies start with 4 uses. Caveat: the counts goes up immediately when a resupply is called, before it lands. ResuppliesCalled Number of resupplies the team has called during the mission. This should increment almost immediately after a resupply is initiated, before another resupply can be called. ResupplyUsesConsumed The number of uses that have been consumed from resupplies this mission. ScoutCount Number of scouts in the lobby. SquareWave Alternates between two values with a given period. Example: Add and remove stalkers on alternating periods of 250 seconds. { \"EnemyPool\": { \"clear\": false, \"add\": [ { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"SquareWave\", \"Period\": 250, \"High\": 1, \"Low\": 0 }, \">\": 0.5, \"Then\": [\"ED_Spider_Stalker\"], \"Else\": [] } ], \"remove\": [ { \"Mutate\": \"IfFloat\", \"Value\": { \"Mutate\": \"SquareWave\", \"Period\": 250, \"High\": 1, \"Low\": 0 }, \">\": 0.5, \"Then\": [], \"Else\": [\"ED_Spider_Stalker\"] } ], } } TimeDelta Change a value over time. Time matches the mission clock in the escape menu in-game, including starting before players receive control of their dwarves. The value is determined by InitialValue + RateOfChange * Max(0, Time - StartDelay) . Parameters: InitialValue : Value at time 0 and up until StartDelay StartDelay : Time in seconds to stay at the InitialValue before changing. RateOfChange : Rate per second to change the value. Example: { \"Mutate\": \"TimeDelta\", \"InitialValue\": 3.1, \"RateOfChange\": 0.0033, \"StartDelay\": 400 } TotalResource Sum of a resource held in players inventories and the group depot.
